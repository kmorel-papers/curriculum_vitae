  abstract = {In computer graphics, color calculations for volumes can be significantly more computationally intensive than that for surfaces. Consequently, until now no interactive
volume rendering system performs these calculations for even linearly interpolated
luminance and opacity without resorting to rough approximations or a finite set of
precomputed values.
In this dissertation, I describe an unstructured grid volume renderer. The renderer is interactive, yet it can produce artifact free images that traditionally would
take minutes to render. I employ a projective technique that takes advantage of the
expanded programmability of the latest 3D graphics hardware. I analyze also an
optical model commonly used for scientific volume rendering and derive new approximations that are exceptionally accurate but computationally feasible in real time. I
demonstrate a system that can accurately produce a volume rendering of an unstructured grid with any piecewise linear transfer function. Furthermore, my algorithm is
capable of rendering over 300 thousand tetrahedra per second yet is not limited by
pre-integration techniques.},
