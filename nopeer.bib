This paradigm holds great promise in its ability to access increased spatio-temporal resolution and leverage extensive computational power. However, the paradigm is also widely viewed as limiting when it comes to exploration-oriented use cases and further will require visualization systems to become more and more complicated and constrained. Additionally, there are many open research topics with in situ visualization. The Dagstuhl seminar 18271 "In Situ Visualization for Computational Science" brought together researchers and practitioners from three communities (computational science, high-performance computing, and scientific visualization) to share interesting findings, to identify lines of open research, and to determine a medium-term research agenda that addresses the most pressing problems.

purpose of this paper is to introduce miniIsosurface,  a miniapplication that is part of the Mantevo suite
of  miniapplications  that  implements  two  isocontouring  algorithms:   Marching  Cubes  and  Flying  Edges.
Miniapplications are small applications that are still complex enough to study larger performance trends.
miniIsosurface  was  explicitly  designed  to  provide  software  developers  and  data  visualization  experts  an
avenue to explore performance characteristics before full-scale development takes place.  Implementations
inside of miniIsosurface take advantage of MPI, OpenMP and GPU.},

A particularly pressing issue is gaining insight into the science behind the exascale computations. Power and I/O speed con- straints will fundamentally change current visualization and analysis workflows. A traditional post-processing workflow involves storing simulation results to disk and later retrieving them for visualization and data analysis. However, at exascale, scien- tists and analysts will need a range of options for moving data to persistent storage, as the current offline or post-processing pipelines will not be able to capture the data necessary for data analysis of these extreme scale simulations. This Milestone explores two alternate workflows, characterized as in situ and in transit, and compares them. We find each to have its own merits and faults, and we provide information to help pick the best option for a particular use.},
