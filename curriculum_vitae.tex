    \begin{cvlist}{Work Experience}
    \item[Graph Visualization] Sandia National Laboratories, 8/05--Present \\
      Explored techniques for visualizing providing information in large
      graph structures.
    \item[Volume Rendering] Sandia National Laboratories, 8/03--Present \\
      Researched and developed unstructured grid volume rendering codes for
      rendering more accurate images in less time.  This includes utilizing
      both CPU and GPU processors as well as employing parallel algorithms.
    \item[Scalable Rendering] Sandia National Laboratories, 8/99--8/05 \\
      Researched and developed parallel rendering codes targeted at
      performing scientific visualization on cluster computers.  Software
      targeted for very large inputs and/or to very large displays.
    \item[Product Realization Environment] Sandia National Laboratories,
      5/96--8/99 \\
      Helped develop/deploy a CORBA-based middleware tool for distributing
      and connecting scientific modeling and simulation codes.
    \end{cvlist}

    \begin{cvlist}{Research Experience (Academic)}
    \item[Doctoral Research] UNM, 8/01--8/04 \\
      Conceived novel mathematical analysis to direct volume rendering
      light transport equation that enables real time display of highly
      accurate, linearly interpolated unstructured volumes.
